# Universal Name Generator

Like the name suggests, this is a universal name generator. It is a simple tool that generates all kinds on names based on word lists that are grouped by categories and by language.

Currently this tool is being developed for the romanian language and the settlement name category. In the future it will support romanian plant and animal names.

The original intent for this tool is to provide an easy and reliable name to generate names for No Man's Sky discoveries.

All contributions are welcome, especially for non-romanian languages and for categories that are not yet supported.
