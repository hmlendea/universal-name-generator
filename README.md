# About
This is a simple tool that generates names based on word lists, grouped by categories and by language.

The original intent for this tool was to provide an easy and reliable way to generate names for discoveries in the "No Man's Sky" video game, but since then it became obvious that this tool has much more potential than just that.

# Roadmap
Currently this project is focusing on improving both it's code and it's word lists. A few features that I seek to bring in the near future include:
- Better UI (easier CLI, but eventually it will be a graphical one)
- New categories for romanian: Person names, animal names, plant names
- Make languages and their word lists as customizable as possible

# Contributions
Feel free to contribute to this repository!

All contributions are welcome, especially those that bring new languages or new categories to the existing ones.
The goal of this project is to support as many languages as possible, and that's not possible without the help of the community.

Note: This project seeks to include fictional languages as well, so feel free to contribute your Valyrian, Klingon or Daedric skills to our cause!
